Create or get a repository using
git init or git clone <repo-url>
(This starts Git tracking for the project.)

Make changes to files in the working directory
(Editing code or creating new files.)

Add changes to staging area using
git add .
(This tells Git which changes you want to save.)

Save changes permanently using
git commit -m "message"
(This creates a snapshot of your work.)

Upload your work to remote repository using
git push origin main
(This shares your work with the team on GitHub/GitLab.)

If you want, I can give a diagram, short 3-line version, or explain for interviews.
